Introduction:
You arrive at the entrance of the Overgrown Graveyard, the smell of rotting corpses is primarily what guided you to this point. The graveyard entrance is surrounded by large ominous black trees that look like they have been dead for years. 

You cautiously begin walking through the entrance way and enter a clearing. In the center of it is a single tombstone. You walk towards it to investigate who had been laid to rest there. 
You rub some dirt off of it and discover it says “This is the gravesite for all who trespass here”. All of a sudden a group of living bones and living corpses begin to surround you. The battle against the undead begins.

You continue past the clearing through a gap between dead trees, past them you see a disgusting looking creature with a crown on it. It looks notably stronger than the rest of the undead, but that does not deter you. You begin your attack against it with the confidence you will end its unholy existence. 

Conclusion:
With the last undead slaughtered, you breathe a sigh of relief. You are covered in the blood of the disgusting creatures so begin to clean yourself off with water from your pouch. The battle has been won, but you know that your quest is not complete until all those responsible have been punished. With a scream of frustration, you vow to vanquish the bandits who helped grow the numbers of these vile undead.
